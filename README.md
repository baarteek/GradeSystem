# GradeSystem

## Overview
GradeSystem is a university-level application designed to manage and display academic grades through a client-server architecture. This project was specifically developed to demonstrate the practical application of the client-server model in managing academic information.

## Purpose
The main goal of the GradeSystem is to serve as an educational demonstration of how a client-server architecture can be implemented in real-world applications. It was not intended to be a fully functional system but rather a prototype to illustrate key concepts for academic purposes.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality for different roles including students, teachers, and administrators.
- **Grade Management**: Allows administrators and teachers to add, modify, and view student grades.
- **Statistics and Reporting**: Provides statistical views of grades for teachers and administrators, such as average grades and rankings.
- **Role-Based Views**: Tailored interfaces for admins, teachers, and students, ensuring appropriate access to information and functionality.
- **Security Features**: Measures implemented to prevent SQL injection and ensure data integrity.
- **Logging**: Integration of log4j to provide detailed logs for system monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Technologies Used
- **Client-Side**: JavaFX, used for developing the user interface, providing a rich and responsive user experience.
- **Server-Side**: Java, utilized for backend logic, ensuring robust and scalable server operations.
- **Database**: SQLite, a lightweight relational database, used for storing user and grade data securely.
- **Security and Logging**: Basic security implementations to prevent SQL injection and log4j for effective logging of system operations.

## Project Status
GradeSystem is not in active development and will not be completed or extended beyond its current state. The project was created as a part of an academic exercise to showcase the design and implementation of a client-server system in an educational setting.
